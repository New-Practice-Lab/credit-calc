# Agent instructions

## Note for Claude users

Claude does not yet recognize the AGENTS.md standards, preferring CLAUDE.md.

If you're using Claude, you can [add a startup hook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6235#issuecomment-3588785967)
in `~/.claude/settings.json` as a workaround.
